# Data-Structures:

* **DataStructures:** systematic way to organize data inorder to use it effeciently.

* **DS:** is all about arrangements of data and perorming eficient operations on that data (inside main memory.)

* **DS:** is a named memory location, where data are stored, organized based on the associated operations. 

1. ds= collection of data values, relationships among data+ collection of operations applied on the data
2. ds= data+operations
3. ds= template+algorithms

* learnig ds+algo essential to write clean and optimized code.

# data-structures operations:

 1.	seaching,
 2.	traversing,
 3.	sorting,
 4. insertion, delation,
 5. merging.

## 1. seaching:

1. **binary search (sorted array):**	to find position of an element.
2. **linear search:** to search for element. 

## 1. sorting:

1. **insertion sort (to sort.):** to check all elements from 0-n;
2. **selection sort(like cards):** sorts from left to right i.e sorted from unsorted.
3. **bubble sort(swaps):** compares adjusant elements,
4. **merge sort:** works on sorted array,
5. **quick sort(divide&conquer):**  time&space complexity matters. for recursion,
6. **bucket sort(like votes):** divides elements into several groups
7. **heap sort:** extract item from heap,
8. **radix:** sorts elements by first group of digit.
