DS: systematic way to organize data inorder to use it effeciently.
DS: is all about arrangements of data and perorming eficient operations on that data (inside main memory.)
DS: is a named memory location, where data are stored, organized based on the associated operations. 

 ds= collection of data values, relationships among data+ collection of operations applied on the data
 ds= data+operations
 ds= template+algorithms


 learnig ds+algo essential to write clean and optimized code.

 ds operations:

 1.	seaching,
 2.	traversing,
 3.	sorting,
 4. insertion, delation,
 5. merging.

2. seaching: 
	* binary search (sorted array):	to find position of an element.
	* linear search: 				to search for element. 

3. sorting:
	* insertion sort (to sort.): 	to check all elements from 0-n;
	* selection sort(like cards): 	sorts from left to right i.e sorted from unsorted.
   ** bubble sort(swaps): 			compares adjusant elements,
	* merge sort: 					works on sorted array,
   ** quick sort(divide&conquer):   time&space complexity matters. for recursion,
	* bucket sort(like votes): 		divides elements into several groups,
	* heap sort:				 	extract item from heap,
	* radix:						sorts elements by first group of digit.
