VARIABLES & ITS TYPES:
----------------------

=>.Variables are  piece of memory or a container wchich holds values.
  "it is a name of memory location in RAM"
  It is the memory-place where we store values".
=>. A variable is assigned with a datatype.
  "Datatype is the type of data in which the variable is stored"

TWO TYPES OF VARIBLES
----------------------

	1.CONSTANT VARIABLE: 
	  "VARIABLE's Value can not change once we assigned"
	  REINTIALIZATION is not possible.
	  * Constants VAR's are declared using the FINAL keyword.
	  "PREMITIVE TYPES can be made immutable/UNCHANGEBLE using the final modifier."
	  * variable's pointer to the value cannot change. 
	    CONST VAR pointer that CANT CHANGE THE LOCATION to which it's POINTING.
	  * The values of the CONSTANT VAR can't be changed once its declared.
	2.LITERAL VARIABLE:
	  * FIXED VALUE ASSIGND to a VAR
	     ratherthan asignig a variable's value or the result of an expression. 
	  * literal VARIABLE is totally based on the syntax.
	  * This specifies the syntax of ur declaration of different types of values& operations
	  * literal is an explicit number or string constant used in Java programs.
	  
=>.To use a variable in a program you to need to perform 2 steps
	* Variable Declaration  eg:int a
	* Variable Initialization eg:a=20;
	  
3 LEVEL TYPES OF VARBLES:
----------------------
LOCAL: These that are declared inside the body of a method.
INSTANCE:declared inside the class but outside the method.
        They are Object specific and are known as instance variables
STATIC: It cannot be local.
		It can also have as many copies which means it can be used for many classes
