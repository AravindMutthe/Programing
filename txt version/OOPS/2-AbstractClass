/*
2.Abstract class:(Abstract keyword)::
* which is containing some defined method and some undefined method or un-Implemented, or abstract method.
* Abstract classes cantains only abstract non static methods(obj), but not contains abstract static methods(class).
  every abstract method is instance but not static.
=> cantains common requirements or features.
=> Every abstract class participates in inheritance.
=> All the abstract classes of Java makes use of polymorphism along with method overriding for business 
   logic development and makes use of dynamic binding for execution logic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     
Abstract Method: which contains only declaration or prototype but it never contains body or definition.
Obj creation:it created indirectly.It means you can create an object of abstract derived class
 ex: parentclass pc=new derivedclass();
