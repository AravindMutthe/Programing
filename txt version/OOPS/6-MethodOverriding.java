/******************************************************************************
Method Overriding:
"if both parent and child classes have one or more methods with same name & types or
same order of parameter lists then its claled MoverLoding".
=> Overriding will always Occurs in differnt Classes.Unlike Overloading.
" Declaring a method in sub class which is already present in parent class"
that a sub class can give its own Defination to a method 
 wch(def) is already provided by the parent class."
=> is used for Dynamic Polymorphism
=> The main advantage of method overriding is that the derived class can give its own specific implementation 
   to a inherited method without even modifying the base class code.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rules:
1.method must have same name as in the parent class.
2.method must have same parameter as in the parent class.
3.must be IS-A relationship (inheritance).
3.Private, static and final methods can not be override.
4.Overriding can be done only at non-static method.
Note: in overriding every things check like method names arguments types return types access modifiers etc.

Super keyword:
  Super keyword in java is a reference variable that is used to refer parent class(object).
  Super is an implicit keyword create by JVM
  Used at 
  1.variable level:
    To access the data members of parent class
    when both parent and child class have variable with same name
    int sum= super.n1+n2;
  2.method level:
    To access the Mem Functions of parent class
    when child class has overridden(uses parent) that method
    super.sum(4,5);
  3.constructor level:
    To explicitly call the defult and parameterized constructor of parent class.
    super();
    super(12,12);
Note: Whenever we are using in the derived class constructors the super always 
      must be as a first executable statement in the body of derived class constructor otherwise we get a compile time error.

"Override" is the cancellation of some previous action or decision. 
"Overwrite" specifically refers to something being written over something previously written. 
 In other words, Actions and Decisions are Overriden.
  Information is Overwritten. furthermore it is overwritten With new information.

Therefore in your example, overwrite is appropriate:

The administrator has the right to overwrite the user time slot for the venue A inside the online system.

A similar example where override would be appropriate is:

The administrator has the right to override all venue decisions made in the online system.
