Python is a dynamically typed, non-compiled (scripting) language.

Java compiles to bytecode and not machine code, 	
------------------------------------------------
JVM is a virtual Machine that provides runtime environment to execute java byte code.

 AI vs ML vs DEEP LEARNING
 
AI is the ability of machines to think and make decisions like humans"
AI is referes to Machine Inteligencece Ai works to create inteliget machines. 
AI is concept of giving the ability of learning to machines.
The number of possible use cases is huge!
AI can support tasks related to this datasets: its processing, analyzing, finding patterns, building predictions,
AI, defined it as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.”
AI is capable of solving harder and harder problems better than humans can.
AI is the machines which are designed and programmed in such a manner that they and think and act like a human
