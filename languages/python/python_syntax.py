				PYTHON CODING FORMATS

#INTRODUCTION:
			
		PYTHON IS A..
		* HIGH LEVEL PROGRAMMING LANG
		* OBJECT ORIENTD PRO LANG
		* STRICTLY TYPED LANG
		* GUI PRO LANG                           //u can design gui using python
		* INTERPRETED LANG                       //executes the code line by line
		* PORTABLE OR PLATFORM INDEPENDENT LANG  //means the code can run any os.
		
#NUMERIC DATA TYPES:
	
	IN PYTHON DATA TYPES ARE USED INCLUSIVELY
	* INTEGER
	* LONG INT
	* FLOAT
	* COMPLEX

#ARTHIMATIC & LOGICAL OPERATORS
	
	* a+b, a-b, a*b, a/b, a%b,a//b
	  a**b==pow(), divmod()
	* >, <, >>, <<, !=, <>
	* &, |, ~, ^
	-----------
	* and == &
	* or == |
	* not == ~
	* in, not in == USED TO MEMBERSHIP TESTS
	* is, not is == USED TO IDENTITY TESTS
	* a[INDEX]== SUBSCRIPTION
	* a[INDEX:INDEX] == SLICEING
	
#TOUPLES && LISTS
	
	1. LIST IS
			* a container which holds comma separated values (items or elements)
			  between square brackets where values need not all have the same type.
			* we can define a list as an object 
			  that obj contains multiple data values.
			* size and values can also be change during execution.we can add or remove values.
			* dynamic array/sequence
			* mutable
			* indexable
			* lists are 3 tpyes
				1. HETEROGENEOUS
				2. INDEXABLE
				3. DYNAMIC
			* we can add to a list to make longer.
			
		Syntax: [],list()range() and xrange():
		
		range(n)=creates list of n integers
		xrange(n)= creates list of integers and creats an iterator.
		to find length of touple/list= len(x)
	
	2. TOUPLE IS
			* same as like lists but u cannot change its values once created 
			* and can hold mix data types.
			* sequence
			* immutable
			* same like lists but immutable.
